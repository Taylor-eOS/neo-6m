This project reads and displays live GPS data from a connected receiver module using a microcontroller.
It continuously listens to the GPS serial stream, decodes the NMEA sentences, and prints structured information such as latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, course, time, date, number of satellites, signal accuracy (HDOP), and fix type.
The output is sent to a terminal interface for easy monitoring, allowing you to verify GPS performance and data quality in real time.
